    <p>One of my favorite things to do is to spend time with family, no matter what we end up doing. My husband and I also enjoy being outside, going for walks, playing video games, traveling, camping, and playing board games. We got married in January and being married is my favorite thing ever!</p>
    <p>I have been a member my whole life and have always had a testimony of the gospel. It wasn't until later in life that I put forth the effort to really know my Savior. I still don't know Him as well as I would like but I think it will be an everyday effort for the rest of my life. My favorite scripture is D&C 101:16, "Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God."</p>
    <p>I am very excited about taking web design, it is something I have wanted to do for a long time. My only concern with doing web and graphic design is AI. I learned recently that fiver let go a good amount of employees because AI could do the work in minutes.</p>
